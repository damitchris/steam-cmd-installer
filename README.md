# steamcmd installer for linux
this linux script will automatically download and install steamcmd and will let either automatically install a game of your choice or just update steam and end there
Plan: make the script put the user input before starting any work so the ycan abort without having to delete the steamcmd folder each time you abort.
. if the script dont work do chmod 755 (the name of the script you took)
